## The game

This game is called **DUNDER MIFFLIN SHOWDOWN**. In the game, you play as Michael Scott.

The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible by avoiding the Dunder Mifflin employees. 

Every time you reset the game, one of three random employees will chase you. 

**YOU CAN ALSO SHOOT PAPER TO GET RID OF THE EMPLOYEES BY PRESSING "T".**
